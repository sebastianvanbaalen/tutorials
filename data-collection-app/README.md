# **Tutorial: Build your own data collection app in R**

This repository contains the source files for the example Shiny app built in my [tutorial](https://www.sebastianvanbaalen.se/uploads/tutorial-data-collection-app) on how to build your own data collection app in R. You can test the example app [here](https://sebvanbaalen.shinyapps.io/data-collection-app/) - simply log in with username `user1` and password `password1`. Note that the raw code in this repository will not work of the shelf, as you will need to create a MySQL database and add your credentials to the app code first. For more information, see the [tutorial](https://www.sebastianvanbaalen.se/uploads/tutorial-data-collection-app).

You are free to use this tutorial and code as you please. If you have any questions, issues with the code, requests for more advanced functionalities, or just inspiring examples of how you've used this tutorial, please contact me!
